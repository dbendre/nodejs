/*
goal: write a program that uses a single synchronous filesystem operation to read a file and print the number of newlines (\n) it contains to stdout, similar to running cat file | wc -l

full path to the file to read is provided as the first command line arg; you don't need to make your own test file

hints: to perform file system operation you need the fs module from the node core library
